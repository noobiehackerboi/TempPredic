# TempPredic -> Temperture Prediction using Machine Learning
Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning

It uses machine learning algorithms to predict the temperture of a given place.
It has to be fed with certain datas like 
*temperature of that place in last certain days(1 month to 100 yrs).
*CO2 level in the air.

NOTE:- This is just an approximation showing how annual increase in CO2 can affect the temperature.
